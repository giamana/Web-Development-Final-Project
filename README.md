# Web-Development-Final-Project
The Bloom & Whimsy website project encompassed modern web design principles, emphasizing the seamless integration of aesthetics and functionality. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Figma, elegant and intuitive UX/UI interfaces were crafted to reflect the boutique’s whimsical essence.  Prototyping was a key step, with detailed mockups developed and seamlessly transformed into a fully responsive website. The design highlighted Bloom & Whimsy’s timeless elegance by incorporating soft pastel hues, vintage-inspired fonts, and delicate floral accents.  The website was designed with functionality at its core, featuring clear navigation and visually appealing product displays that showcased the brand’s unique offerings. Personalized styling session options were integrated to align with Bloom & Whimsy’s customer-focused approach.  The final result was a beautifully polished website that not only highlighted the boutique’s distinctive products but also offered an engaging and user-friendly shopping experience, inspiring connection and creativity.
